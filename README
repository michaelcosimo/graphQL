With this updated code, you can use the "after" argument in your GraphQL query to paginate the posts using the cursor-based approach. For example, using the following cURL request:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "query": "query { posts(first: 2) { edges { cursor node { id title } } pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor } } }"
}' http://localhost:8080/graphql
You will get the first 2 posts in the response along with the pageInfo containing hasNextPage and endCursor information for further pagination. To fetch the next set of posts after the cursor, use the "after" argument with the cursor value from the last item of the previous page.

For example, to fetch the next 2 posts after the cursor "2", you can use the following cURL request:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "query": "query { posts(first: 2, after: \"2\") { edges { cursor node { id title } } pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor } } }"
}' http://localhost:8080/graphql
This approach enables efficient pagination with cursors, providing a scalable and user-friendly way to navigate through large datasets.
